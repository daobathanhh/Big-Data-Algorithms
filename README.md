# Big Data Algorithms Implementation

This repository contains from-scratch implementations of classical big data and data mining algorithms for learning and experimentation purposes.

## Implemented Algorithms (to date)
- BFR clustering
- CURE clustering
- SON frequent itemset mining
- PLANET: scalable distributed framework for learning tree models

## Notes
- Implemented from scratch without relying on built-in ML libraries
- Focused on algorithmic logic and scalability concepts
